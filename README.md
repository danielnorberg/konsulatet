# konsulatet
Selenium script to scrape for Swedish consulate passport renewal appointments

## Usage

1. Get a [Sinch](https://www.sinch.com) trial account, get a Sinch phone number & verify the phone number you want to send sms to
2. `brew install maven` (if you donâ€™t have maven + java)
3. `git clone git@github.com:danielnorberg/konsulatet.git`
4. `cd konsulatet`
5. `SINCH_PLAN_ID=badf00d SINCH_TOKEN=badf00d RECIPIENTS_NUMBERS=+12222222222,+13333333333 SENDER_NUMBER=+14444444444 ./run.sh`
6. Verify that you get the hello world SMS on startup, otherwise something is wrong and you might not get any notifications for appointments.

* The `SINCH_PLAN_ID`, `SINCH_TOKEN` env vars should be set to your Sinch plan ID and auth token.
* `SENDER_NUMBER` should be your assigned Sinch phone number that will send the SMS.
* `RECIPIENTS_NUMBERS` Can be one or more comma separated numbers to send an SMS to. Note that the numbers must be verified in your Sinch account.

## Note

* The application checks for open appointments in both the Washington DC Embassy and the NYC Consulate.
* The `run.sh` script tries to run the application forever and restart it on crash.
* An SMS is sent if the application crashes so you can debug and get it up and running again.
* SMS are throttled to not notify more than once an hour for either embassy or consulate. To clear the throttle: `rm -rf sms-sent`.
* Headless chrome is used via selenium, this seems to make regular Chrome behave a bit strange at times.
